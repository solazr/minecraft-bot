I have to give most of the credit to SonicandTailsCD https://github.com/SonicandTailsCD. this was ment to jusy be a single time ting where i upload thos for people on kaboom to use but SonicandTailsCD has done his best to make this project easy and ready to use. Big thanks to him. I might not upadte this too often so the most up to date version would most likely be on here: https://github.com/SonicandTailsCD/Minecraft-Protocol-Basic-Chat-Bot

This is ment to be a very basic minecraft chat bot verification system with hardcoded commands for beginners. Go ahead and do what you want with it.

How To Run
1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download repository
3. Extract the files to your directory of choice
4. Open a terminal
5. Navigate to the current directory (if you havent already)
6. Run 'npm i minecraft-protocol'
7. Once that has finished update the values in the code that need to be changed (port, ip, botname, etc)
8. Run 'node index.js' in the terminal to start your script

Note
I recomend downloading some sort of IDE. I use VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

If you change the name of the main file, in this case index.js, then you need to adjust the command to be 'node updatedFileName.js' to start it
